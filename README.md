# Optimization-with-PuLP
Developed an optimization model using PuLP to maximize profit by deciding the number of units to produce for two products under labor and material constraints. Formulated and solved the linear programming problem in Python, demonstrating how optimization techniques can support business decision-making.

In Task 4, I explored the powerful concept of business optimization by applying Linear Programming (LP) techniques using the PuLP library in Python. This task was designed to simulate a real-world scenario where decision-making under constraints is critical, such as optimizing resources, maximizing profit, or minimizing cost.
Optimization is a key skill in data science, especially in domains like logistics, finance, operations research, and supply chain management. In this project, I applied these principles to a simple yet meaningful example — maximizing profit for a manufacturing business that produces two types of products under limited resource constraints.

PuLP is a powerful Python library for modeling linear optimization problems. It provides a clean, intuitive syntax for defining variables, constraints, and objectives, and supports various solvers like CBC, GLPK, and CPLEX. It’s ideal for beginners and professionals alike and is widely used in academic and industrial applications.


Problem Statement
A company manufactures two products — Product A and Product B. Each product generates a specific profit per unit:

Product A earns ₹20 profit per unit.

Product B earns ₹30 profit per unit.

However, production is constrained by:

A total of 240 hours of labor

A total of 100 units of raw material

Each unit of Product A requires:

4 hours of labor

2 units of material

Each unit of Product B requires:

6 hours of labor

1 unit of material

The objective is to determine the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B that should be produced to maximize total profit without exceeding the labor and material limits.

Implementation Using PuLP
Using the PuLP library, I translated this mathematical model into a Python program.When the model is solved, PuLP returns the optimal values of A and B that yield the highest profit under the given constraints.

This task reinforced several important data science and optimization concepts:

Mathematical modeling: Translating business problems into solvable equations.

Constraint formulation: Handling limited resources as mathematical boundaries.

Objective function design: Clearly defining what needs to be maximized or minimized.

Decision variable selection: Choosing what quantities the model should solve for.

Solver integration: Automating the optimization process using code.

*OUTPUT*

This task gave me hands-on experience in formulating and solving business optimization problems using Python. I learned to think both analytically and practically — turning a basic word problem into a structured model, and solving it with code. Tools like PuLP are critical for any data scientist or analyst working in decision science or resource-constrained domains.It was exciting to see how just a few lines of code could help make powerful, real-world decisions that can improve efficiency and profitability in any organization.
